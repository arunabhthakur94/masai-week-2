                <h2>The History of Tea: Legends from China and India</h2>
                <p>Tea's origin story is infused with a blend of myth and fact and colored by ancient concepts of spirituality and philosophy.
                        According to Chinese legend, the history of tea began in 2737 B.C.E. when the Emperor Shen Nong, a skilled ruler and 
                        scientist, accidentally discovered tea. While boiling water in the garden, a leaf from an overhanging wild tea tree 
                        drifted into his pot. The Emperor enjoyed drinking the infused water so much that he was compelled to research the 
                        plant further. Legend has it that the Emperor discovered tea's medicinal properties during his research.
                        Indian history attributes the discovery of tea to Prince Bodhi-Dharma, an Indian saint who founded the Zen 
                        school of Buddhism. In the year 520, he left India to preach Buddhism in China. To prove some Zen principles, 
                        he vowed to meditate for nine years without sleep. It is said that towards the end of his meditation, he fell 
                        asleep. Upon awaking, he was so distraught that he cut off his eyelids, and threw them to the ground. Legend 
                        has it that a tea plant sprung up on the spot to sanctify his sacrifice.<br><br>
                        In one popular Chinese legend, Shennong, the legendary Emperor of China and inventor of agriculture and Chinese medicine 
                        was drinking a bowl of just boiled water due to a decree that his subjects must boil water before drinking it. Some time 
                        around 2737 BC, a few leaves were blown, from a nearby tree, into his water, changing the color and taste. The emperor took 
                        a sip of the brew and was pleasantly surprised by its flavor and restorative properties. A variant of the legend tells that 
                        the emperor tested the medical properties of various herbs on himself, some of them poisonous, and found tea to work as an 
                        antidote.<br><br> 
                        Shennong is also mentioned in Lu Yu's famous early work on the subject, The Classic of Tea. A similar Chinese legend goes 
                        that the god of agriculture would chew the leaves, stems, and roots of various plants to discover medicinal herbs. If he 
                        consumed a poisonous plant, he would chew tea leaves to counteract the poison.<br><br>
                        A rather gruesome legend dates back to the Tang dynasty. In the legend, Bodhidharma, the founder of Chan Buddhism, accidentally 
                        fell asleep after meditating in front of a wall for nine years. He woke up in such disgust at his weakness that he cut off his 
                        own eyelids. They fell to the ground and took root, growing into tea bushes. Sometimes, another version of the story is told 
                        with Gautama Buddha in place of Bodhidharma.<br>

                <h2>Tea Today</h2>
                <p>Today, tea is the world's most popular beverage after water. At Mighty Leaf Tea, we proudly carry on centuries-old 
                    tea traditions by packing our artisan, hand-crafted tea bags with unique, one-of-a-kind whole leaf tea blends, herbs, 
                    and spices from around the world.Iced tea originated at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri. A tea merchant 
                    from abroad had intended to provide visitors with free hot tea samples. However, due to the unusually hot weather, it 
                    was not a big hit. To promote sales, he asked a nearby ice cream vendor for some ice, which he dumped into the brewed 
                    tea. Thus, the American iced tea tradition was born. Today, iced tea makes up around 80% of the entire U.S. tea market 
                    sales.<br><br>
                    In general, even though India leads the world in tea technology, the methods employed to harvest the crop vary with the 
                    type of tea and terrain. Fine-leaf tea is hand plucked, and hand shears are used on mountain slopes and in other areas 
                    where tractor-mounted machines cannot go. A skilled worker using hand shears can harvest between 60 to 100 kg of tea per 
                    day, whereas machines cut between 1,000 and 2, 000 kg. The latter, however, are usually applied to low grade teas that 
                    often go into teabags. The tea "fluff" and waste from processing is used to produce caffeine for soft drinks and medicine.<br>
